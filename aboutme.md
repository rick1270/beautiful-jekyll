When I was 13 years old, I used to dial up Charles Schwab every day to get the prices on a list of stock that somehow seemed interesting to me. This was high techâ€¦ the alternative was to wait until the next days newspaper where the closing prices would all be listed. I was sure that having the information before other people would somehow give me an advantage. Upon receiving the information, I would use my pencil to meticulously mark the prices on graph paper. Taking great care to differentiate between 3/4 and 7/8 (back then prices were reported in fractions). Looking back, this marked the beginning of a life long interest in data.
